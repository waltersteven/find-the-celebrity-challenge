# Find the celebrity challenge

## Author: Walter Pariona.

### Description:
The purpose of this project is to solve the challenge by using a simple algorithm that iterates through a given list of people.

Explanation of the algorithm can be found inside each method.

The logic of the challenge has been split into packages to keep a clean project structure.

Run the app, and the console should output who is the celebrity. In case there is no celebrity, a "No celebrity found in people." message will be displayed.

### Testing:
The app has a test file with 2 use cases that verifies the following scenarios:

1. Test when a celebrity exist in people
2. Test when celebrity does not exist in people
